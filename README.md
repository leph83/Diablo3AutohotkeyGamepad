Diablo3AutohotkeyGamepad
========================

Diablo 3 is an awesome game. But I always wanted to play it with a gamepad. Since I already started playing on the pc and don't want to begin all over again on the ps3 just to play with a gamepad I started looking for a solution for my problem.

I have heard of Joy to Key, pinnaclegameprofiler and Xpadder. I tried pinnaclegameprofiler and Xpadder. The first used to crash when I wanted to edit the settings. But it worked pretty good. Xpadder was ok, but I couldn't figure how to center the mouse position for better movement.

Then I stumpled upon http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/103395-diablo-3-gamepad-control/ this site.
It is an autohotkey script which does almost exactly what I wanted. 

With xpadder you had to move the mouse button with the right analog stick and push the mouse trigger to move.
I wanted to move the character with just the left stick. pinnacle had that solution and I liked it.
With the Autohotkey Script it does exactly what I needed. With the left analog stick you use the force move button (you gotta define that in the diablo 3 settings) and the cursor is in a fixed area around the character.
